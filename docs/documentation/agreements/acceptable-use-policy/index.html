Continued use of Azion’s Products and Services constitutes acceptance of the AUPs, as modified.</p>      

<h2 class="black-small-title">1. Illegal use</h2>

<p>Azion’s Products and Services (collectively “Products and Services”) may be used only for lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export Control laws.</p>

<h2 class="black-small-title">2. System and Network Security</h2>

<p>Violations of system or network security are prohibited, and may result in criminal and civil liability, in addition to suspension or terminate of Products and Services. Azion will investigate incidents involving suspected violations and may involve, and will cooperate with, law enforcement if a criminal violation is suspected. Examples of system or network security violations include, without limitation, the following:</p>

<p>Unauthorized access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without express authorization of the owner of the system or network. Unauthorized monitoring of data or traffic on any network or system without express authorization of the owner of the system or network. Interference with service to any user, host or network including, without limitation, mailbombing, flooding, deliberate attempts to overload a system and broadcast attacks. Forging of any TCP-IP packet header or any part of the header information in an email or a newsgroup posting.</p>

<h2 class="black-small-title">3. Usenet</h2>

<p>Posting the same or similar message to one or more newsgroups (excessive cross-posting or multiple-posting, also known as “SPAM”) is explicitly prohibited.</p>

<h2 class="black-small-title">4. Email</h2>

<p>Sending unsolicited mail messages (SPAM), including, without limitation, commercial advertising and informational announcements, is explicitly prohibited. A user shall not use another site’s mail server or system to relay mail without the express permission of the site.</p>

<p>In addition, this policy applies to any email or content transmitted by a user or on a users behalf which uses a Azion account as a mailbox for responses or promotes content hosted or transmitted using Azion facilities, or which indicates in any way that Azion was involved in the transmission of such email or content.</p>

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, this AUP applies to any email or content transmitted by a user, or on a user’s behalf, using Azion Products and Services, accounts, mailboxes, and/or facilities, which indicates in any way that Azion endorses or is involved in the transmission of such email or content.</p>

<h2 class="black-small-title">5. Copyright/DMCA</h2>

<p>Azion respects the intellectual property rights of its customers, end users and third parties. Without limiting its rights and remedies hereunder, Azion complies with all aspects of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (42 USC 512) (“DMCA”) and maintains and enforces a policy whereby it might terminate Products and Services to any customer guilty of repeat infringement.</p>
