<h2 class="medium-title-gray">Pricing Example</h2>

<p>If your applications deliver 600 million images in the United States within a month and the offload to your content is 95% that is, 95% of your content is delivered to the cache without having to query the source 30 million of images by Image Processor.</p>

<p>The first 10 million images processed will be priced at $ 1.60 for every 10,000 images, ie (10,000,000 / 10,000) x $ 1.60 = $ 1,600.</p>

<p>The next 20 million images processed will be priced at $ 1.26 for every 10,000 images, ie ($ 20,000 / 10,000) x $ 1.28 = $ 2,560.</p>

<p>The total amount to be paid in this simulation will be 4,160 USD.</p>
