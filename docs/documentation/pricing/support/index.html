<h2 class="medium-title-gray">Pricing Example</h2>

<p>If your monthly consumption with Azion in one month was $ 90,000, the support amount will be calculated as follows:</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Enterprise:</h3>

<p>For the first 10,000 USD, 10% will be charged, thus 1,000 USD support.<br>
    For the next 70,000 USD, 7% will be charged, therefore 4,900 USD support.<br>
    For the remaining $ 10,000, 5% will be charged, so $ 500 support.</p>

<p>In this simulation, the total amount of Support Enterprise will be $ 6,400 in the month.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Mission Critical:</h3>

<p>For the first 60,000 USD, 10% will be charged, thus 6,000 USD support.<br>
    For the remaining 30,000 USD, 7% will be charged, thus 2,100 USD support.</p>

<p>In this simulation, the total value of Support Mission Critical will be $ 8,100 in the month.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Slack Channel</h3>

<p>An additional support channel that enables direct contact with Azion&#39;s engineering team.</p>

<p>Optional item, available to Azion Support Mission Critical customers only, at a monthly cost
    of $ 2,000.</p>
