<h3 class="small-title-orange">Real-Time Purge Operations</h3>

<p>This is the number of operations to <em>purge</em> objects from the cache, whether by URLs, <em>Wildcard URLs</em>, or <em>Cache Keys</em>.</p>

<p>The first 1,000 purge operations each month are included for all customers. From this volume on, you will pay $ 5 per 1,000 additional purges.</p>

<h2 class="medium-title-gray">Pricing Example</h2>

<p>If your applications received 750 million requests from the United States in 1 month, consuming total traffic of 30 TB, and you were within the limit of 1,000 purges that month, the amount will be calculated as follows:</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Total Data Transferred</h3>

<p>The first 10 TB of traffic is priced at $ 0.085 per GB, so 10,000 x $ 0.085 = $ 850.</p>

<p>The next 20 TB of traffic is priced at $ 0.080 per GB, so 20,000 x $ 0.080 = $ 1,600.</p>

<p>In this example, the value for the month will be $ 2,450.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Requests</h3>

<p>Requests are billed every 10,000 for the unit price of $ 0.009, so (750,000,000 / 10,000) x $ 0.009 = $ 675.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Total charges</h3>

<p>The total amount to be paid in the month will be $ 3,125, according to the simulation.</p>

<h2 class="medium-title-gray">L2 Caching</h2>

<p>An additional layer of cache that reduces traffic to your origin while improving performance and availability.</p>

<p>Optional item, when using L2 Caching, Total Data Transferred will be calculated as the sum of Edge Caching traffic and L2 Caching traffic.</p>
