<h2 class="medium-title-gray">Pricing Example</h2>

<p>If you have hosted 30 zones in Intelligent DNS and received 1.5 billion queries over the month, the value will be calculated as follows:</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Hosted Zones</h3>

<p>The first 25 zones are priced at a unit price of 25 USD, thus 625 USD.</p>

<p>The remaining 5 zones are priced at a unit price of 15 USD, hence 75 USD.</p>

<p>In this example, the 30 zones will cost 700 USD.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Standard Queries</h3>

<p>The first billion queries will be priced at $ 0.85 per million. Therefore (1,000,000,000 / 1,000,000) x 0.85 USD = 850 USD.</p>

<p>The remaining 500 million will be priced at $ 0.40 USD per million. So 500 x 0.40 USD = 200 USD.</p>

<p>In this example, the calculated value will be 1,050 USD.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Amount</h3>

<p>The total amount to be paid in the month will be 1,750 USD, according to the simulation.</p>
