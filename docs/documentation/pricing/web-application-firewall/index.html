<h3 class="small-title-orange">Rule Sets</h3>

<p>This is the number of WAF configurations or rule sets, that can be shared between different domains.</p>

<p>The first 50 rule sets are included for all customers. From this volume, $ 200 will be charged per <em>rule set</em>.</p>

<h3 class="small-title-orange">Rules</h3>

<p>Rules are the number of rules created by the client for both release (<em>whitelist rules</em>) and block (<em>blacklist rules</em>).</p>

<p>The first 200 rules are included for all customers. From this volume, USD 5.00 will be charged per <em>rule</em>.</p>

<h2 class="medium-title-gray">Pricing Example</h2>

<p>If your applications received, in 1 month, 3 billion requests from the United States and their WAF settings are within the limits of rule sets and rules, the value will be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>The first billion requests will be priced at 0.025 USD for every 10,000 requests. Therefore, (1,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.025 USD = 2500 USD.</p>

<p>The next 2 billion requests will be priced at $ 0.024. Thus, (2,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.024 USD = 4,800 USD.</p>

<p>The total amount to be paid in the month will be 7,300 USD, according to the simulation.</p>
