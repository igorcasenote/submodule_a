<h3 class="small-title-orange">Queries</h3>

<p>This is the number of total queries at Real-Time Events. The first 1,000 queries per month are included for all clients. Starting this volume will be charged USD 0.10 per query.</p>

<h2 class="medium-title-gray">Pricing Example</h2>

<p>If your applications have 300 TB traffic in a month, much of that volume is data, such as payload, and some metadata, such as HTTP headers, the request made, the status, or user information.</p>

<p>Real-Time Events collects some of the metadata, which is available for your query. The metadata collected represents on average 0.2% of your traffic.</p>

<p>In this simulation, 600 GB (300 TB x 0.2%) will be collected.</p>

<p>The first 400 GB will be billed at a unit price of 1.50, ie 400 x 1.50 = 600.</p>

<p>The 200 GB remaining will be billed at a unit price of 1.20, ie 200 x 1.20 = 240.</p>

<p>The total calculated amount in this simulation will be 840 USD, considering the 1,000 queries were not exceeded.</p>
